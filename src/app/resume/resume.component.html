          I create custom applications designed to reduce redundancy, minimize
          errors and organize data
          for everyday work processes. I have a strong ability to rapidly learn
          new concepts with
          attention to detail, a talent to communicate clearly and listen
          intently in order to translate
          my clientâ€™s requirements into software products. My productivity is
          driven by my goal to be a
          developer who can see everyday routines develop into software tools to
          assist you.
